Repo for exploratory analysis of OSMI 2016 Survey data

## Description

[Open Sourcing Mental Illess (OSMI)](https://osmihelp.org) has an ongoing survey from 2016, which "aims to measure attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace, and examine the frequency of mental health disorders among tech workers." The survey is conducted online at the OSMI website and the OSMI team intends to use these data to help drive awareness and improve conditions for individuals with mental illness in the IT workplace. 

I've used these data as part of the first monthly [Dataset Challenge on data.world](https://medium.com/the-data-science-download/partnering-to-help-students-build-their-data-science-credentials-8773fb35f49e#.o04qr7h6j). 

I found this dataset challenge to be an excellent opportunity to apply some of what I have been learning from my ongoing studies at Coursera. 

Important Note: I used plotly to generate "interactive" figures from my ggplot2 objects. They will not appear in the markdown (`.md`) file. Please head over to [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/dnrichardson/osmi) to see the `html` report with working plotly figures.
